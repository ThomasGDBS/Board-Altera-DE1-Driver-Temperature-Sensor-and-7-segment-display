# Board-Altera-DE1-Driver-Temperature-Sensor-and-7-segment-display

The Hardware and Software course is a second master course whose objec-tive is the construction of a VHDL driver coding project. We decided towork with an Altera DE1 Board and the latest version of Quartus II andModelsim.

To make this project, we have divided this tutorial into different parts:

The first part illustrates the correct use of the Quartus II and Modelsimprograms, introducing the I2C protocol at the same time.

Then, a part will be dedicated to the management of the link between thestate machine and the temperature sensor (resolution of the measurements).

We will then discuss the use of the seven-segment readers incorporated inour FPGA board. We will take a particular interest in the format used, inparticular with a BCD algorithm.

Finally, we will build a global application described as follows: A temperature sensor displaying its results on the seven-segment readers of an AlteraDE1 board
